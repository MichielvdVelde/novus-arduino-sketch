# novus-arduino-sketch

This is the Arduino sketch I am using for my home automation system (Novus).

The sketch runs on an Arduino board which has the following:

* A temperature and humidity sensor ([DHT-22](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167))
* A sound threshold sensor (sends a signal on loud sounds)
* An LDR for estimating light conditions
* A 433mhz transmitter
* And IR LED for use with IR remotes

This is a highly specific sketch and may not be that interesting. For more info, [read the readme for the component attached to it](https://github.com/MichielvdVelde/novus-serial).
